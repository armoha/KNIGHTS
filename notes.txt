CURRENTLY
	implementing stats and attribute changes

TODO
	implement drawline function
	implement drawcircle function
	for orbiting projectiles to look good will need opposing orbit of different graphic
	maybe should be able to choose the image for the orbit and the "true" projectile separate, can choose to hide the center image.
	implement acceleration for projectiles
	create unit death function that only uses a single unit id and can have elevation changes
	implement attribute increase functions so all calculations are done in one place
	re-do armor and health toughness calculations because it seems messy and dont know if it actually works correctly.
	see if changing size of khalis crystal works now that theres no preplaced
	in the future could replace string arrays with get functions item id as argument.
	damage display system anytime you do damage it should show what caused it and how much damage it was.
	make it so weapon use effects are a function so they can just be cast by whatever player and work correctly, so monsters can have the same skills as the player
	some sort of allocation system for computer players and then values are obviously attached to players
	make it so players are put into the active units array and are checked during collision checks and other things

STORY
	what if this place is a giant floating island in the sky that is the second stage before ascending to an eternal battle ground.
	normal life is below and eternal battle is above. But the reality of it is that its a type of planet with floating islands surrounding it that only certain kinds
	of people can ascend to. Or maybe the most powerful people on the planet have access to some kind of special technology or magic that allows them to ascend to these
	islands. The whole reality of the planet below is just preparation for defense from ethereal alien invaders from space hell or something.
	The floating island the player is inhabiting is sort of a training ground to ascend further to join the defense of the planet. The people below are all ignorant
	of this defense and totally unaware and they just believe the greatest warriors are going on some great crusade or journey into the sky to never return.
	Which they are, but the details are left out. The floating island which the game takes place on has captured creatures from the stars that get are controlled
	by greater warriors watching the players from above. The rank you're given at the end of your trial determines where you are placed in the heavenly battle.
	If you successfully remove the "thorn" from the land you are chosen and you will ascend to join the heavenly battle as a glorious warrior.
